✨ **This workspace has been generated by [Nx, a Smart, fast and extensible build system.](https://nx.dev)** ✨

App builded with Vite + React + Ts + redux-toolkit + redux-persist+ react-bootstrap + formik + yup

Additionally, I have followed the [Feature Sliced Design (FSD)](https://feature-sliced.design/docs) methodology for structuring the application.

## Start the app

1. Install all the required packages by running:
   `npm install`
2. To start the development server run `npm run start`. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:4200/. Happy coding!
